              I couldn’t tell you the month, the season, or even the year at this point, of when this shift inside me occurred.
              But one day, in my darkest moment yet, I realized that I had measured my success, fulfillment, and life’s
              satisfaction on a narrative that has been embedded in me as a result of it being embedded in our patriarchal
              culture for the last five thousand years. In the moments after, I became completely disillusioned with the
              outer world and no longer felt any nourishment from it. I had been on a path that I thought I was to be on -
              the path where I attained academic and financial success but that in reality left me exhausted, over-scheduled,
              and unbalanced.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I left the comfort and security of ‘home’ behind me, and I set out on a new path, down the river of
              unconsciousness. I began using the notion of the old bone woman in the desert as described by Dr. Estés in her
              book Women Who Run With Wolves as a powerful, inspirational symbol – a guide for my inner journey to the soul.

            <p>
              There is an old woman who lives in a hidden place that everyone knows but few have ever seen... The sole work of
              La Loba, [the Wolf Woman], is the collecting of bones. She is known to collect and preserve especially that which
              is in danger of being lost creatures: the deer, the rattlesnake, the crow. But her specialty is said to be wolves.
              She creeps and crawls and sifts through the montañas, mountains and arroyos, dry river beds, looking for wolf
              bones, and when she has assembled an entire skeleton, when the last bone is in place and the beautiful white
              sculpture of the creature is laid out before her, she sits by the fire and thinks about what song she will sing.
              And when she is sure, she stands over the creature, raises her arms over it, and sings out. That is when the
              rib bones and leg bones of the wolf begin to flesh out and the creature becomes furred. La Loba sings some more,
              and more of the creature comes into being; its tail curls upward, shaggy and strong.
            </p>
            <p>
              And La Loba sings more and the wolf creature begins to breathe.
              And still La Loba sings so deeply that the floor of the desert shakes and as she sings, the wolf opens its eyes,
              leaps up, and runs away down the canyon.

            <p>
              My image of that old woman guided me to recover the parts of myself that had become diluted and gone underground
              in the world of career and modern society. On this new path I carried with me a lifetime of suffering and
              sweetness, of mistakes and breakthroughs. On this journey of transformation I was confronted with all the
              striving I had done for things to be different. There were ‘the bones’ of me in that striving that I had
              forgotten and had left behind; a strong sense of who I was, what my place is in this world, what my service
              is in this life, and the power to create, to guard, and to transform. I learned that what I perceived to be
              in the way is actually the way. So I let go. I relaxed. I began a journey of gathering and singing over my
              newly found bones. All that effort of striving was replaced with a flood of peace, humor, loving kindness, and
              with a longing to live with direct access to the Divine inside the sanctuary of my soul. The La Loba story
              gave me context and helped me to move beyond the disparate parts of my story and towards healing.
            </p>
            <p>
              La Loba keeps collecting bones and bringing wolves to life; and that is my service, too. Every time I pause to
              hear the Divine singing over my bones, I rise up with new eyes to see the lost bones of others. What song shall
              I sing over them?

            <p>
              I spent the last twenty years working in several different roles with my training as an educational psychologist,
              primarily working with the special needs population. I was passionate about this work till the day I walked away
              from it - something I never thought I could or would do.  Towards the end of this career, when things were the
              darkest, I received a message from Spirit:  “How much do I have to throw at you till you pay attention?”
              Literally. That was the message. I knew then that I could no longer ignore this calling. It wasn’t a question
              anymore if I wanted a relationship with the unknown. But the soul is uncertain and uncharted, and it takes
              courage, stamina, and space to go exploring that part of yourself. I spent too many years cycling in my dark
              night of the soul, but I began to understand that my ‘crisis’ was actually a spiritual crisis. This recognition
              finally allowed me to travel forward on the path toward healing and transformation instead of staying in the
              oscillating suffering from the dark night. As I have entered into the second part of this journey called life,
              it became obvious to me that the tools I used during the first part of the journey were no longer useful.
              I needed a whole new tool kit. I have spent years now learning to trust alternative ways of knowing self, others,
              and our world.  I now know how to attend to and receive Spirit and truth, and thus become of greater service to
              the world.  What I have learned and find so inspiring is that it is really only the grit of my experiences, not
              the over-thinking mental space, that is where true transformation occurs. I now look for invitations; and
              consider sufferings ‘graced potentials.’ Encouragement and support is essential to bring healing and
              transformation into form. The Divine has shown me the beauty of the raw energy at the intersection of the
              crossroads. And now this is where I most love to work.

              A choice for personal growth is always available to us, but the true challenge that exists in every “crisis”
              is the question at the crossroad: can I engage in my capacity to empower myself or will I give in to that fear?
              When we’re at a crossroads, we’re invited to go into the unknown of our lives. This is not easy. This is work.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the root of all the services I offer, I am a Spiritual Director. I am your companion to guide you to your own wisdom.
              My role is that of a respectful listener, holy witness, and facilitator in exploring life’s big questions.
              I feel grateful that I’ve been able to bring my love of archetypes, mythology and sacred teachings of global
              mystics to be in relationship to the service of other people... to you. In working with me you will come
              to learn and listen to your own wisdom. It is a different shift than one may be accustomed to, as we are not
              striving for “normal”; rather, we seek transformation. And for this to occur, it must happen at the street
              level... at the imperfect, vulnerable, gritty, messy crossroads of life. The utilization of the services
              that are offered work together to bring a deeper healing, a deeper reconciliation, a deeper awareness, and a
              fullness to your transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growth has many dark nights and evolution many more. Life will always be about transforming - a series of
              birth, growth, death and rebirths. There will always be some trepidation of the unknown, but you can exist
              in the space in-between.
